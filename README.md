### Hi, I'm Alec Morris ðŸ‘‹


I've been enjoying web development since I was in middle school writing my first HTML file on a home-built desktop running Linux. I have a love for JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as TypeScript, Node, Angular, React, Express, Bun, and jQuery. I'm currently on the lookout for a role in backend web development, ideally writing in Java, JavaScript, or Python. I'd especially like to work at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
